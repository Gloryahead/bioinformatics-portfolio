A professional portfolio showcasing robust computational pipelines and data analysis projects in Omics and machine learning.

# Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome! My name is **Michael Aderibigbe Arowosegbe**, and I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in Pharmacology & Toxicology at the University of Arizona.  

I specialize in **epigenomics, NGS data analysis, and emerging computational drug discovery**.  
This repository serves as a portfolio of my bioinformatics skills, scripts, pipelines, and ongoing technical learning.
